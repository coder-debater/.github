# Hi! o/

ðŸ‘‹ I'm [coder-debater](https://github.com/coder-debater/), affilated with [debater-coder](https://github.com/debater-coder/), but we are not the same person (our names do suggest otherwise!)

I'm working on:
1. [SBHS Portal Tools](https://github.com/coder-debater/SBHS_Portal_Tools) right now, they're exactly what they sound like: tools for using the SBHS (Sydney Boys High School) Portal API.
2. [???](https://github.com/coder-debater/Untitled-TopDown-Game) (more coming soon)

Feel free to ask me if you have any concerns.

Thanks!

WD (coder-debater)
